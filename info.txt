understand what different commands folder used for here cmd
understand what are those vendors 
understand what are sensors here --> pkg/sensors/sensors.go
understand other components used and the operator
be able to track one flow of tracingpolicy

there is ds tetragon what is it ?


operator is in ./operator 
cilium/tetragon will get all cmd/tetra*

what are their roles exactly ?
./operator  is the usual operator for k8s 
cilium/tetragon is one container under tetragon pod and it is through that we will do all those operations

when u do functionality related things then tetragon comes into action
tetra is a tool to extract info from the things running 

what is podinfo for ?? -- maybe some other project is watching it 


Daemon process:

Loads/unloads BPF programs.
Monitors policy changes, writing policies into eBPF Maps. In non-K8s environments, it monitors policy updates in file directories.
Provides an external gRPC API, listening on 127.0.0.1:54321. CLI execution is essentially through this API interacting with the Daemon.

accomplished through Tracing Policies. TracingPolicy, a custom resource of Tetragon, allows users to trace arbitrary events in the kernel and define actions to be taken for matched events.

Policies consist of hook points (supporting kprobes, tracepoint, and uprobes) and selectors for kernel filtering and specifying actions.

what is those ebf maps 

understand where where different communications taking place , where is the role of cilium , through grpc whats its done 
understand what are the different pkg/ and how they do
